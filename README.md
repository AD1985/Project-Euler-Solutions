# Project-Euler-Solutions
Submission for project euler problems

Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) is a website dedicated to programming problems. It has over 500 problems and new problems are added every week. You can get more details about the site from its wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler).

I worked on some of the initial problems and made this repository to publish those using Python.

Some solutions are naive since I had just started learning Python and thought the best way to learn it is to solve problems using Python.
